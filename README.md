# Movie Practice App

Welcome to MoviePracticeApp.com! This repository serves as the base environment for the Movie Practice App. The Movie Practice App provides an interactive platform for users to browse and filter movies. It includes features such as language filtering, genre filtering, and decade-based filtering. The setup includes a starter HTML page, a JavaScript file, and sample JSON data to facilitate your development process. We've integrated a lightweight web server, lite-server, and a user-friendly CSS library, Semantic UI, to enhance your experience.

## Setup Prerequisites

Make sure the following software is installed on your machine:

- Node.js
- Visual Studio Code
- git
- Preferred web browser (Chrome is recommended, but Firefox should also work)

## Configure Project

Open a command prompt and clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kirankiru14/https---github.com-kirankiru14-SFtraining/tree/Final-Javascript-Project


## Running the Project

- Execute command `npm start` on terminal window. This will start the `lite-server` on port 3000 and open a new tab on your default browser to show the project home - index.html. 
- The server automatically watches for changes in any html, JavaScript, and CSS files and automatically refreshes the browser tab. This allows you a seamless development experience.
